# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We Run The City üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[https://we-run-the-city.netlify.app/]()

We Run The City is a full stack app where you can search for running clubs in Amsterdam, see and write their reviews, like them and add new running clubs. You can also see the parks in Amsterdam where you can run, training hours, price and level of training, so you can compare them and decide where to go for a training. You can also find running locations for each training on a map.

## Technologies used:

### Frontend

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React-Redux
- Node JS
- Cloudinary API
- JEST Testing

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express REST API
- JWT & Bcrypt Authentication

## User stories

### As a user, I can:

- sign up to make an account and login. When I sign up, I can upload my image. This way I can post reviews and like running clubs. ( MVP)
- see existing running clubs, their likes and reviews. I can see them sorted by their number of likes in a descending order. (MVP)
- see the name of user who posted a review and the time and date of when it was posted. (MVP)
- see the existing running clubs on a map and get to their detail page when clicking on them. (MVP)

### As a logged-in user, I can:

- add like and add review of running clubs. (MVP)

### As an running club owner, I can:

- login as a running club owner. This way I can add a new running club to the list of running clubs. (MVP)
